#macpro from apple today. Hope so along with iPad 5 &amp; iPad mini 2
i really hope I can buy a retina iPad mini today.
I'm pretty excited for the Apple event today. Have my fingers crossed for Retina iPad Mini's and Mavericks being available today.
I have an iPad Mini. I don't use it. Not at all.
Can someone tell me how much an iPad mini is???
#appleevent better announce a new iPad mini
hoping for iPad mini w retina, which could be a BFD
Mavericks release, Retina Thunderbolt Displays, Retina iPad Mini, new iPod(s).
Saying that a retina iPad Mini sounds like a nice device, the horrible screen on the original was it's only real down point.
I swear tarsa em moth! I get a iPad mini and a new ones coming out today.

So, @sedacy_w won a iPad mini. But it's basically worthless. http://t.co/Ac7pfYqSr1
iPad mini like design. Thinner, lighter.
So what's the iPad mini?
This is smart, separates the iPad and the iPad Mini, easier to differentiate them in store marketing etc..
All of a sudden my iPad mini looks like a Surface.
there already is an iPad mini tho
Hmmmm what about the iPad mini
starting to lose hope that there'll be a retina ipad mini today. #AppleEvent
They're saving the iPad mini til last
Apple adds Retina display to iPad Mini.

the iPad mini has the same processor and resolution and is cheaper
iPad Mini, now with Retina Display, 2046 x 1358 screen at 7.9 inches.
So they deliver an retina iPad mini, but no 4K display? Come on Apple.
iPad Mini is now Apple's main iPad
Damn, the iPad mini has an A7?
Retina display on the new iPad mini
Alright.... Here we go Apple, make the new iPad Mini 349$ and you'll have a sale.
The new iPad mini has retina display now!!!
I'm surprised that Apple kept the iPad 2 and discontinue the iPad Mini (non retina). That would have been better for a lower price point.
prayers are answered.. iPad mini retina...
Here it is. The iPad mini with retina
iPad mini gets A7! Another unexpected surprise!
 @shawnblanc: Retina iPad mini. And the people rejoiced.  I'm rejoicing
The new iPad mini is insane
Retina iPad mini - TAKE MY MONEY NOW
iPad Mini with Retina display announcement means that @donnamatrix's xmas present is going to be the old iPad.
Yes then! iPad Mini with Retina Display.
iPad mini is a power house.
iPad Mini resolution is amazing! That's a huge amount of pixels in a 7,9  screen. #iPadMini
Yup, getting the iPad mini. Definitely.
iPad mini gets Retina display. #AppleEvent 
Anyone want an iPad mini?  The Original  
iPad Mini is just as powerful as it's big brother, no difference anymore.
And, as widely expected, the iPad mini gets retina display.
Whoa... A7 in iPad mini. Now I'm torn.
"@willsmith: Retina iPad Mini."  Anyone want to buy a regular iPad Mini...? &gt;_&gt;
Retina Display finally across to iPad Mini. Should have been available at launch.
I'm not impressed by any of these numbers for the iPad mini. These are all things that should have been introduced in the first model.
iPad Mini up next. Now has a Retina Display. 4x faster than the previous CPU, 8x faster graphics, 10 hr batter life. White/Black @ $399
Should I buy @champion_matt a new iPad Mini?
iPad mini is up to 4x faster at CPU tasks, 8x faster graphics, 10-hour battery life, same MIMO Wi-Fi and LTE improvements.
Finally the #iPad mini has the same cpu as the real iPad.
Not bad, 324 PPI in the new Retina iPad Mini
Now the iPad mini have retina display #AppleEvent
Ooo $299 iPad mini and 399 for iPad mini retina
Original iPad mini at $299.  Hrmmm.
Ipad mini gets retina display
New ipad mini with retina display http://t.co/dkCW2DXj1k
Hm the iPad mini with retina is 70 more. But I still want it!!
Reduce original iPad mini, 299. New iPad mini 399.
iPad mini with Retina display will be priced at $399 and will be available later in November. #AppleConference
Stafrom $529 for iPad mini 4G LTE, pretty expensive &gt;_&lt;
And just like that $299 for the old iPad mini.
Base iPad mini starts at new, lower $299.
iPad mini with retina display
So for $400 you can get a three I generations old iPad or a brand new iPad Mini? I don't think I understand.
Glad you didn't buy the iPad mini with these new announcements today. #Applenerd
Smamove by Apple to make the old iPad mini $299. #apple
iPad Mini with Retina Display #ShitiLike
WHY WOULD YOU BUY AN IPAD 2 OVER AN IPAD MINI RETINA????
iPad mini at $299 is a steal, $399 for the mini Retina though, ouch.
New iPad Mini: $0  No, just kidding.
100 dollar price break for the iPad mini without retina? What a great discount. #not
Retina iPad mini hooray! iPad mini original gen is sticking around too! This is a pretty great lineup!
iPad mini rip off. Could get a PS4 for the same amt
You want iPad mini?
Old iPad mini is still available and has dropped in price! Crazy. #TSApple
IPad mini priced at $399  #AppleEvent
get the iPad mini. Retina display and A7 chip for cheaper. More worth it.
iPad mini with retina display and a7 ship cpu with wifi and 3g with 10 hours battery # 
Let the pictures do the talking.#ipad mini. http://t.co/C5sClDOkal
my iPad Mini Air Book Pro 2 with Retina
iPad mini had retina display now
Yeah, but I think I can buy my wife an iPad mini, or get a new one for me and give her my mini
iPad mini with retina display.. Tampaknya menarik... [pic]   https://t.co/pCHFx8uW59
There she is, a Retina screen for the iPad mini, $399 up from $329. But... old iPad mini sticks around for $299. Also kinda weird.
iPad mini has retina display and the new A7 chipset with 64-bit architecture. 10 hours battery life, LTE suppohttp://t.co/HDlJdrhT46
Old iPad mini and iPad 2 in the lineup is for Wall Street, not customers: non-retina iOS 7 is fugly!!
So gee I can get a great #iPad Mini for $399 or a old as hek iPad 2 for the same price...
Isn't the iPad mini retina a much better deal than the iPad 2 at the same price why keep that thing around?
Things that worry me: $399 for iPad mini w/ retina display is a lot. Keeping the iPad 2 makes little sense to me.
New iPad mini um, yes, please.
Cheaper iPad mini and iPad 2 staying around = great news for schools.
I have $399, should I get an iPad Mini with Retina Display or an iPad 2? Oh god such as a hard choice...
Ipad mini retina display 399$ ishh trop chere jgarde mon mini lolll #iPadmini #AppleKeynote #AppleEvent #Apple
$299 voor 'n iPad mini, gratis iWork, gratis iLife, gratis OS X. #AppleKeynote
iPad mini smacase http://t.co/uUdT57Vl3n
All I needed from my iPad mini was #Retina!!
I have $399, should I get an iPad Mini with Retina Display or an iPad 2? Oh god such a hard choice...
I was so gonna buy an iPad mini, but I'm not about that $399.
So do we take it that the iPad mini with retina is the same dimensions as the current mini? #AppleEvent
Glad to see Retina iPad Mini though!!! That's the one I am going for #Apple
The screen on the new iPad mini is going to look stunning. What's the DPI on that thing now then? #AppleEvent
I think I'd rather have an iPad mini with the current display, A7 processor, and twice the battery life.
iPad mini Retina with A7. Take my money already.
#cnetlive finally retina display in  the ipad mini i love it but i want to see a Apple store in San Juan Puerto Rico
iPad mini looks cool I guess but I still don't need a tablet.
Not so sure how I feel about Apple pricing the Retina iPad mini just $100 cheaper than the full-size iPad
And that's a wrap. All things considered, I'll most likely end up with a 32GB iPad Mini in Space Gray.
Seeing as there was no mention of the new iPad Mini weight I'm guessing it's the same or heavier.
That's it, I decided I want an #iPad mini with retina display #Apple #loveit
Why is the iPad 2 still around? It's 3 years old and the price hasn't changed in 3 years! At the same price, just get the old iPad Mini.
  @Breexed: How to Use Your iPad or iPad Mini as a Phone http://t.co/3M94QwAJDy 
Store is still down and no Mavericks in the App Store yet. I wonder when I can pre-order my new iPad mini?
Ah well, looks like I'll be getting an IPad mini! 
iPad mini with retina is more expensive? #imout
iPad mini with retina display.....YES PLEASE!
iPad mini retina that is (geez these names are almost as confusing as cheese types) looks cool but I still don't really need a tablet.
I wish I could somehow justify getting that new iPad mini. 
That was pretty good. And iPads shipping November, so time to get ready! *sells iPad Mini on eBay*
I wanted a new iPad mini though tbh
iPad Mini finally with Retina-Display and A7 chip! #appleoctoberevent #update [pic]   https://t.co/T5XaeXH1qm
I feel like such an idiots for buying an open platform, $270 Nexus 7 32GB rather than waiting for the non-shit iPad mini 32GB for $500.
Anyone who buys an iPad 2 now is the biggest prune on the planet. Much like anyone who bought the original iPad Mini.
My take: I skip generations of iDevice (not made of money). OTOH, my Retina iPad is annoyingly heavy &amp; iPad Mini is too small for typing ...
Superb set of product announcements today from Apple; Retina iPad Mini, Mavericks free, Mac Pro. Will Retina Macbook go to 16GB though?
iPad mini with Retina Display http://t.co/dlOK8NtW1m
The new stuff is already in the Apple Store App but at least the retina iPad mini can't be ordered yet. 
Right. Why would someone spend $399 on the iPad 2 when the iPad mini is also $399 but has a retina display and an A7?
iPad mini dimensions not discussed?
guess I'm going to have to change the name of my iPad mini now 
iPad Mini and Air are specced the same! Love it!
Hmmm, tempted to buy an iPad Mini now, but can't really justify it quite yet.
I'm asking about iPad mini retina, not the air
iPad Mini w/Retina... Faster, Retina DIsplay, A7 Chip, 10 Battery Life... thats what im talking about!! #CantWait announce a release date!!!
I feel like such an idiot for buying an open platform, $270 Nexus 7 32GB rather than waiting for the non-shit iPad mini 32GB for $500.
The iPad mini Retina at $399 will sell. But for that form factor the $229 Google Nexus 7 is really attractive. I would even go for it.
Compete? They dominate the tablet market. iPad mini (without retina) is now $300
I missed the launch date for the iPad mini retina. Is it the 1st November too?
Wow, iPad mini with retina, A7 and 128 Gb of memory, god it's amazing!
apple can make retina at first iPad mini version. I feel like they are cheating and sell two time for iPad mini &gt;.&lt;
finally an iPad Mini with Retina Display.
I may get a iPad mini there 399 and the old iPad mini r now is 299.
iPad mini site is not up yet / broken for me. http://t.co/1xEwp9Sp07
FYI, you can now buy a 128GB iPad mini. #apple
Ugh. iPad Mini, PS4, XBone, iPhone 5S, vacations, xmas, and my dishwasher's broken. It's gonna be an expensive six months.
ipad mini with improvements sa screen and processor lang? goodness apple.
Well now that the iPad Mini has a retina version, I do believe it's time for an upgrade #GeekProblems
   @9to5mac: iPad mini with Retina display will have 128GB version for $699 http://t.co/mXNZsM2Oag 
New iPads look pretty good, but I'm good with my current iPad mini right now I think. I don't need retina, my display is good
1 Retina iPad mini for me please
iPad mini retina @ $399; old model @ $299. Not bad!
Retina iPad Mini. Mavericks is free. Mac Pro starts at  2,499
Ipad mini with retina display 399 bucks. Hmm
Apple announces new iPad mini to have a "retina" display. Gets new A7 chip. Faster CPU, graphics &amp; wi-fi. Starts at $399. Ships in November.
Finger print sensor absent in both new iPads ... Good news only retina ipad mini  #AppleEvent
Waitaminute... No gold iPad Mini? Apple missing out on a cash cow... #AllGoldEverything
Apple keeps original iPad mini in lineup. They have dropped the starting price to $299.
 @jonfortt: iPad mini with retina at $399  soon as they put a fone in the Mini I'm sewing on a bigger CLEAR pocket on my shirts!INNOVATION!
My TL's reaction to Apple's event was mostly positive. Either because of Mavericks, iWork, and retina iPad mini; or because it was live. =)
Crap! I told Gazelle I would sell my iPad b/c I want the iPad mini. But I don't when it will be available.
it is faster with updated  CPU  check the iPad mini https://t.co/KDsju556W0 @abd_abzakh
GG, you pay the same for an iPad mini retina 4G with 128GB as the 32GB iPhone 5s Oo

iPad mini is 331g. With 10 hour use on a single charge and a 64bit A7. Amazing work from the Apple hardware teams. Kudos.
Excited for new MBP Retina &amp; iPad Mini Retina. Looks like it was worth waiting. Bummed no #FCPX news.

Retina iPad mini of full size iPad??? In dilemma now
Unlocked iPhone 5s 16GB: $649 iPad mini Retina 16GB w/ 4G: $529  It wouldn't be that weird, right? I mean, there are bigger Android phones.

"@Gizmodo: New iPad Mini meta hands-on: ravishingly Retina http://t.co/wxZ08nY126" yes! I may consider getting one now.
From a developer standpoint: is the original iPad Mini still good at its new price point?
iPad mini for $300 or Kindle Fire HD for less than $200. How is that a decision for anyone? #overpriced
And the iPad Mini as well: http://t.co/e6PBGPlH4M
iPad mini with retina. You betta' get it, Apple.
iPad Mini will not be staying home. It will be my daily commuting to work device.
iPad mini with Retina Display, A7 processor, more storage options puts Nexus 7 second gen to shame - just the iPad mini I was waiting for
Ipad mini 2 #cantwait
Mavericks OSX is free, iPad mini has a retina display, and the Pro looks AMAZING. #nerdheaven #NOTaPC #applefangirl
I'm finally impressed with this Apple conference! I can't wit to pick up the iPad mini w/ Retina display. It leaps 2 gens of specs! Love it!
I want iPad mini.
Having said that.. I WANT-ney-NEED a Retina iPad Mini in my life.
You'd pay the same price for your 2.5 yr old tablet as you would the brand new iPad mini? Both are $400 (thought it was 300).
Is Google allowed to say that anymore? Or is the iPad Mini rounded up to 8"? http://t.co/X4vXGl8qk1

Hiya, use my iPad mini 24/7 but have Galaxy tabs in school. However you must check out Explain Everything, Notability, Phoster
Tempted to swap my iPad4 + Ultrabook combo to a new iPad mini + Yogapad 2 pro. Seems it would cover my travel+game+code use cases better...
new iPad Mini with Retina Display in November?  Looks like a Christmas present for Mrs. O
Looks like the iPad mini with Retina Display is the device that'll replace my ageing first-generation iPad. Some time in the future.
I just seen how much they are charging for the new iPad mini, I'm probably going to get a nexus 7.
iPad mini nice step up for 3.5  iPhone users.  But not enough size increase from Note 2/3, so sticking with iPad.
Sent my iPad mini to its new owner today hoping to have a new retina one in two weeks. Alas I have to wait until later in November.
Way to be the first to say the phrase Rachelle Lim of Popseyes in Campbell River - Enjoy your new #iPad mini from #gfsbc!

 @CNET: A $399 iPad Mini? Wrong way, Apple http://t.co/2Dotaqs0Ia  and the new lower cost iPad should be iPad 3 or 4, not 2.
iPad Mini, PS4, or a new snowboard. My life is so damn stressful. #firstworldproblems
As expected, my 1-month old iPad mini lost $100 of its value today. Taking it back.
Definitely getting a retina iPad mini. Considering trading in my iPad 4th gen. But, I prob won't. I use it rarely compared to my mini.
Have I missed something, or an iPad mini with retina costs 10  LESS than an iPad 2?!
The #iPad Mini Finally Gets a Retina Display http://t.co/PTYnshmOQm
I want the iPad Mini Retina
#iPad mini retina. One preorder please!
iPad mini. Retina. A7. 32GB. Space Gray. I love you. I'll buy you. In 30 days. In Barcelona. Period.
When's this iPad mini retina going on sale so I can get one already?
do you mean the iPad mini?  If not, the Retina iPad has been discontinued.
For those who want an iPad 2, think again. iPad Mini 2 is just better and at the same price, iPad 2 is woefully outdated...
I think the release date for the iPad Mini is missing from http://t.co/Nj1mXYmTCO.

Yes thanks, I hope you both are well too. Sorry for the late reply, you got lost in the turmoil of the #AppleEvent

Ok #Apple need to update from 10.8.4 to .5 - software not certed for 10.9, but no 10.8,5 choice - have to dl manually ala win 8.1?
